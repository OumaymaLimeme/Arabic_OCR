## Setting up a classification system for a pdf document written en Arabic

Optical character recognition (OCR), or “ocerization”, refers to computer processes for translating images of printed or typewritten text into text files.
A computer requires OCR software to perform this task. This makes it possible to recover the text in the image of a printed text and save it in a file that 
can be used in a word processor for enrichment, and stored in a database or on another medium that can be used by a computer system.

The project consists of:
1- Develop a PDF document recognition tool written in Arabic using OCR.
2- Classify the document according to content by referring to labels
